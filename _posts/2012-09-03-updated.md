## Updated!

I've been messing about with all kinds of things lately, and have decided to update the look of this blog with the intent to post more on it.

### Newness

I've hacked Bootstrap 2.0 in. I could probably hack the latest version in too, but I've made a zillion css changes that I can't be bothered to redo :D. Hosted on [github pages](http://pages.github.com) for sure. The workflow of just scribbling down some markdown and pushing to a git repo is just perfect, I'd love to get an insight on how they do it so I can do it here at work!
