<p>Our department has a kind of standing meeting every Monday, where someone (picked at random using a Matlab script, pffft, <em>Scientists</em> eh? :D) gives a talk. Normally this is pretty science-y, being a research group and all - but today I gave a shortish talk on my outlook of Cloud Computing. </p>

<p>It's a pretty rambly affair (it was kind of chucked together on the balcony on a lovely sunny day with a beer in hand) but I guess the main things I wanted to get across were:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><i class="icon-star"></i>   IaaS is hard, so use (mature) Infrastructure Automation tools like <a href="http://opscode.com">Chef</a> to manage your servers as code</li>
<li><i class="icon-star"></i>   A lot of the sales bullshit about 'The Cloud' being all automatic and magic with regard to scaling and resilience is precisely that - bullshit</li>
<li><i class="icon-star"></i>   PaaS is awesome and people need to read more about how great people like <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>) are</li>
<li><i class="icon-star"></i>   Modern Cloud providers are offering a varied and useful box of tools to build applications and organisations on top of - some better than others</li>
<li><i class="icon-star"></i>   It's mostly about letting experts get on with what they're expert at and getting things going quicker, at a scale which fits rather than a best guess</li>
</ul>
</p>
