<p>I&#8217;ve hacked Bootstrap 2.0 in. I could probably hack the latest version in too, but I&#8217;ve made a zillion css changes that I can&#8217;t be bothered to redo :D.

The workflow of just scribbling down some markdown and pushing to a git repo is just perfect, I&#8217;d love to get an insight on how they do it so I can do it here at work!</p>
