<p>Our department&#8217;s web developer had to step out to have a baby, so I got the chance to dabble a little with Rails again. It&#8217;s been a while, despite being a massive fan of the framework back in the mid 00&#8217;s. I got hooked on <a href='http://sinatrarb.com'>sinatra</a> back at Sony when we were putting together our crazy &#8216;Magick&#8217; app to manage cloudformation stacks in ec2, and it was very weird to go back to the comparitive heft of Activerecord and scaffolding. It wasn&#8217;t terrible, and I was kind of handed the reins halfway through so there&#8217;s a bunch of things I&#8217;d have done differently given the time.</p>

<h2 id='whats_the_site_about'>What&#8217;s the site about?</h2>

<p>So there&#8217;s this open source movie, right - the Durian project - or <a href='http://sintel.org'>Sintel</a> as the actual thing is called. Big push for <a href='http://www.blender.org'>Blender</a> devs as far as I could see, but very cool in both it&#8217;s execution and delivery. Because all the assets are open, you can do whatever you like with it as long as you credit the original team. So! Science. Ever heard of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow'>Optical Flow</a>? Because I certainly hadn&#8217;t. This stuff&#8217;s really important in the process of helping computers learn how to track and see stuff, so it&#8217;s a big deal for my group - <a href='http://ps.is.tue.mpg.de'>Perceiving Systems</a>. A couple of students have taken this movie and turned it into a massive (the biggest, I believe) dataset describing Optical Flow. Scientists from all over can download this data and then run their estimation algorithms against it to see how &#8216;good&#8217; it is. There&#8217;s a stack of metrics to measure against, none of which I really understand! :)</p>

<h2 id='anything_exciting'>Anything exciting?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s <a href='http://rubyonrails.org'>Rails 3.2</a>, which meant lots of new things I wasn&#8217;t aware of like the asset pipeline and some project layout changes. Had to get down and dirty with <a href='https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano'>Capistrano</a> again for the first time in ages, which was refreshingly fun. It was nice to have something to really tune for speed for multiple deployments. Also had to figure out a way to keep a single sqlite3 instance available across releases, which was a pain. MySQL support for Rails seems to be all well and good still, but complex to manage as a different DB abstraction in more than one environment - wanted to have sqlite3 for dev/staging and then MySQL for prod - didn&#8217;t happen. Might do in the future if we need to worry about scale, but I don&#8217;t think we will :D</p>

<h2 id='future_things'>Future things?</h2>

<p><a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/'>Bootstrap 2.1</a> is in there already, which I love to bits. Could probably look at learning more about their javascript plugins, I do like the carousel and the spiffy collapse-tabs. We&#8217;ll see, eh?</p>
