<p>I&#8217;ve been unreasonably excited about <a href='http://www.meteor.com'>Meteor</a> since finding out about it a few weeks ago. Now I&#8217;ve actually done something with it!</p>

<h2 id='what_exactly_have_you_done'>What exactly have you done?</h2>

<p>We got a goooorgeous new espresso machine a few months ago, and now we&#8217;re all kind of getting into the swing of using the thing. I went to grab a coffee the other day and realised we were a crack team of IT development genii and we could do better than the scrap of paper sellotaped to the wall with checkmarks on it next to our names&#8230;</p>

<h2 id='yes_so_what_exactly_have_you_done'>Yes, so what EXACTLY have you done-</h2>

<p>I took the &#8216;leaderboard&#8217; example that meteor ships with (<code>meteor create --example leaderboard</code>) and changed it a bit. I added some prettiness (the easy bit) and some functionality (the hard bit). Had to learn a bit more javascript/nodejs, a little MongoDB and brush up on my css. Was fun!</p>

<h2 id='future_things'>Future things?</h2>

<p>Would be nice if I could track/show shots consumed per day/week/month/year, but that&#8217;d involve more complexity on the mongodb end which I will need to really read up on. I would like to investigate moving it to redis as well so I could use <a href='http://redistogo.com'>redistogo</a>. Maybe some kind of OAuth integration, so people could link their &#8216;Connoiseur&#8217; with their twitter/github/facebook account. I dunno, maybe overkill :)</p>
