I'm Jon Anning, and I'm the resident Systems Administrator for the <em>relatively</em> new <a href="http://ps.is.tue.mpg.de">Perceiving Systems</a> group, which is a part of the only really recently formed <a href="http://is.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a>.

<p>I suppose I'm at least nominally responsible for anything with a plug on the end of it - whether it's a printer, a phone or the world's most accurate and detailed 3D Body Scanner.</p>

<p>I love fixing problems with interesting tech and putting big smiles on faces.</p>
